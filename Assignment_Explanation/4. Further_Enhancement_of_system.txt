This file touches on the topic of, when our system will start to break and how I would go about enhancing/improving, or scaling the system.

Following are a few scenarios of when our system will start to break:
1. The system I have built can scale up to some extent because I have used good design patterns/ architecture, it can handle up to somewhere around 10k req/sec(not tested)(needs to be tested using load/stress testing tools like k6/Jmetre), but if the traffic goes beyond that then our system will eventually break.
2. If there are too many DB operations, then the performance will start decreasing.
3. If there is heavy traffic routed to only one service, then there will be a huge amount of latency in serving the requests.
4. If the errors are not logged and the system is not monitored, we will lose the observability of the system and will not be able to tune it for better performance.
5. If no robust security mechanisms are employed, then our system will be vulnerable to many attacks.
6. If our system is not tested extensively, then there is no guarantee that our system is resilient and fault-tolerant.    

Following are the few things I would consider for enhancing/improving or scaling the system:
1. I would write many test cases, including unit/integration tests and e2e tests using tools like jest and cypress.
2. If the traffic starts increasing gradually then I would start vertically scaling the system, by adding more resources to existing servers up to a certain extent after that its not possible due to h/w limits.
3. If there is even more traffic then I will horizontally scale by adding more servers and since we already adopted microservices architecture, scaling only specific services will not be an issue and I would implement a load balancer to distribute the load equally.
4. I would look into various microservices interaction patterns like aggregator pattern, asynchronous messaging, circuit breaker, etc.., and would choose best based on the context.
5. If there is a need for faster data access I would cache using Redis.
6. For efficient DB operations I will consider writing more efficient queries and indexing and then partitioning, replication or sharding if needed.
7. Extensively use message brokers like rabbitmq or Kafka for performing various kinds of asynchronous operations.
8. Configure DB backup, in case we lose the data.
9. For security purposes I might use hashing/encryption and auth libraries, API keys, rate limiters, firewalls.
10. For hosting I would opt mature hosting platforms like AWS/GCP/Azure and for CI/CD I would use git/GitHub, circleCI/Jenkins, Docker along with Kubernetes.
11. For logging, I will consider using datadog or Winston and morgan and for monitoring, I might consider using Prometheus or all together ELK stack.
12. To improve the communication between our frontend and backend, I might consider using other connection patterns like socket connection or grpc or graphql and might try to implement http2, all based on the context though.
